### ✺ &nbsp; THE MANIFESTO

We are a collective of developers and data scientists building at the edge of what's possible. We don't just ship code; we engineer **validity**, **performance**, and **aesthetic precision**. 

Our focus is singular: removing friction between complex data and the user experience.

---

### ◉ &nbsp; THE ARCHITECTURE

We utilize a strictly typed, high-performance stack designed for scalability.

| **INTERFACE** | **ENGINE** | **INTELLIGENCE** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Next.js 14` | `Node.js` | `TensorFlow` |
| `React` | `Prisma ORM` | `Scikit-learn` |
| `Framer Motion` | `PostgreSQL` | `Pandas` |
| `Tailwind CSS` | `Docker` | `Python` |
